    // 1. How functions work in JS?
    
    // 2. At first a global execution context is created, which consists of Memory 
    // and code and has 2 phases: Memory allocation phase and code execution phase.

    // 3. In the first phase, the variables are assigned "undefined" while functions 
    // have their own code.

    // 4. Whenever there is a function declaration in the code, a separate local 
    // execution context gets created having its own phases and is pushed into the call stack.

    // 5. Once the function ends, the EC is removed from the call stack.

    // 6. When the program ends, even the global EC is pulled out of the call stack.
