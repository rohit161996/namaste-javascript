    // Execution Context is created even before the execution of the program.
    // It is called the Global Execution Context.
    // With undefined var variables.

    // Execution context has two component:-
    // 1) Memory component [Variable Environment] 
    // -This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key 
    // value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

    // 2) Code Component[Thread of Execution]
    // -This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

    // ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // With every function invoked an Execution Context is created.
    // After the function executes and returns the Execution Context is deleted.
    // The Global Execution Context is also destroyed.

    // ------------------------------------------------------------------------


    // "undefined" it is a keyword which is assigned to variables during 
    // the memory allocation phase

    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Call Stack 
    // It traces the Javascript program, like how it is being executed.
    // It maintains the order of execution of execution contexts.
    // Also Known as 
    // 1. Execution Context Stack
    // 2. Program Stack.
    // 3. Control Stack.
    // 4. Runtime Stack.
    // 5. Machine Stack.
