    // How JavaScript works?
    // Ans - Everything in JavaScript happens inside an "execution context".

    // Execution context has two component
    // 1) Memory component [Variable Environment] 
    // -This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

    // 2) Code Component[Thread of Execution]
    // -This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

    // Note-
    // 1. JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language
    // -Single threaded means JavaScript can execute once command at a time
    // -Synchronous single-threaded that means JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.

    // 2. Asynchronous operations can be performed using the 
    //    callback function like setTimeout().

    // The function and variable is created before execution of program 
    // with undefined value and function definition itself.

    // Execution Context is created before the execution of the program.
    var a = 10;
    function execute() {
        var num = a + 10;
        console.log(num);
    }

    // Now the variable is assigned value = 10
    // and function is written in the memory
    console.log(a);
    console.log(execute());
