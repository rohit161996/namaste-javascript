    // 1. Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language.
    // 2. Asynchronous operations can be performed using the 
    //    callback function like setTimeout().

    // The function and variable is created before execution of program 
    // with undefined value and function definition itself.

    // Execution Context is created before the execution of the program.

    function execute() {
        var num = a + 10;

    // Now the variable is assigned value = 10
    // and function is written in the memory
    console.log(a);
    console.log(execute());
